> ABSTRACT:
> 
> A psychiatrist once asked our lab if it was possible to annotate their medical notes so that it's easier for his patients to understand the medical jargon found throughout the document. I am building a dynamic JavaScript widget that meets these needs. My plug-n-play widget will take in a medical document and dynamically tag all medical key terms. Once the tagging process is complete, the widget displays a pop-up information box for each key term. The pop-up information box holds related meta-data for users to further their understanding of the medical notes. Currently, I am working towards computing the most relevant definitions and relationships to display within the pop-up information box. To make this possible, I plan to connect several libraries together: a tagger to identify terms, a set of programs to organize and retrieve definitions, and additional tools to enable approximate matching and ranking to get the best possible results. This work is part of a larger project, Lexi â€“the Medical AI, which is a robust medical knowledge graph with multiple applications and endpoints, such as my knowledge widget.
